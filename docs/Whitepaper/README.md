## 1. Project Background

Nowadays, the problems of Ethereum network congestion and high handling fees are becoming more and more serious. Solving the problem of network congestion and achieving scaling is the direction that many researchers have been working hard on.

A successful solution to the scaling problem of public blockchain is not only related to transaction throughput, it must also be achieved. The system meets the needs of millions of users without sacrificing decentralization. In the context of this era, technological breakthroughs cannot be delayed.

In the absence of technological breakthroughs, existing scaling solutions have to make major compromises to one or more of the above requirements. Fortunately, the latest developments in Zero-Knowledge proofs have opened up entirely new possibilities for solving this problem.

Today, zkTube is honored to introduce to you our masterpiece: Ethereum's trustless scaling and economic applicability solution based on zkRollup, emphasizing the excellent experience of users and developers. The zkTube Protocol is designed to bring visa-level throughput of thousands of transactions per second to Ethereum, while ensuring that funds are as safe as Layer 1 accounts and maintain a high degree of censorship resistance.

zkTube is based on the concept of zkRollup. In short, zkRollup is a Layer 2 scaling solution, in which all funds are held by smart contracts on the main chain, and calculations and storage are performed off-chain. Each Rollup block will generate a state transition Zero-Knowledge proof, which is verified by the main chain contract. SNARK contains proof of the validity of each transaction in the Rollup block. In addition, the public data update of each block is released as low-cost call data on the main chain network.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 zkTube Introduction

zkTube is a project built and developed on layer2 based on the PLONK algorithm protocol using ZK-Rollup technology. It can improve scalability by transferring batches of transactions to a single transaction. Its essence is to compress the user state on the chain and store it in a Merkle tree and transfer the user state change to the chain while ensuring the correctness of the user state change process under the chain through a Zero-Knowledge proof mechanism. The cost of directly processing user state changes on the chain is relatively high. But cost of only using the smart contract on the chain to verify the correctness of a Zero-Knowledge proof is relatively low. In addition, the required remittance information is transmitted to the contract along with the certificate, which is convenient for users to verify accounts.

It needs to be emphasized that it is still submitted on the Ethereum chain, but part of the work on the chain is transferred to offline completion, so it will be as safe as Ethereum.


**Lower Cost Per User Transfer**

The transfer between off-chain tokens costs only 300â€“500 Gas, since each rollup operation splits the settlement cost of a single block evenly across the packing block from L2 to L1, reducing the Gas charge. The proof of updating the Merkle tree can be provided. Also, if the cost of transferring the single-chain L1 token is at least 20,000 Gas, we can reduce the Gas charge in the form of the Rollup.

**Throughput and Scalability**

Each transaction contains less data, thereby improving the throughput and scalability of L2. You can directly use the L2 account balance to transfer directly, and you do not need to wait for the confirmation at the L1 layer to arrive. In this process, users can freely use their balance but, in the end, it is necessary to complete the final certainty at the L1 through a Zero-Knowledge proof mechanism.

**Ethereum Mainnet Level Security Guarantee**

In the zkTube network, a large number of computations and data storage operations are placed in L2 for processing, after which a large number of transactions are aggregated and packed into the same block. A Zero-Knowledge proof is generated and sent to L1 for uniform verification, which can improve the transaction processing speed of the whole network and ensure security.



**The Ecological Value to ETH**

By using the underlying protocol of zkTube, the ETH Gas charge is reduced, and user transactions at Layer 2 are more frequent than previously at Layer 1, thus solving the problem of ETH congestion. In addition, applications that require high TPS or related functions have been solved on zkTube Layer 2. When the Mainnet is launched, zkTube provides the underlying protocol support services to users and applications vendors based on the zkTube Protocol, which enables better migration of applications and contracts on Layer 1. This is what zkTube desperately needs. The idea is to build an ecosystem based on ETH Layer 2.

### 2.2 Functional Overview

### 2.3 The following is a functional overview:

- zkTube supports mutual transfer from Ethereum L1 and L2, allowing users to receive funds without creating a wallet. 

- Supports transfers to an Ethereum address or Ethereum contract address (contract address supports L2 zkTube Protocol).

- To transfer of L2 or withdraw to the account of L1, the processing fee is temporarily supported by ETH. After the mainnet is launched, only the native token ZKT of the zkTube Protocol is supported for payment.

- The zkTube Protocol supports all swap transactions in the ETH ecosystem on both L1 and L2.

- The zkTube Protocol supports purchases in fiat currency directly to the L1 account or the L2 account.

- The zkTube Protocol supports direct sales of fiat currency to L1 or L2 accounts.

- Both the L1 account and the L2 account support linking to NFT applications.

- Support for the Polkadot cross-chain protocol.

- Supports Solidity language for developing smart contracts.

- Supports ERC721 

## 3. Frame Design

### 3.1 Principle

![Principle](https://file.zktube.io/images/whitepaper/Principle.png)

The first account with an account ID of 0 is used for depositing the storage cost until it is withdrawn to L1. 

Currently 2^32 L2 accounts and 2^11 tokens are supported. Each L2 account has a unique number, starting from zero. The default value 0 is the verifier account. The account token contains the following information (PubKeyHash is the public key information of L2 account).

The random number of each account (other than the random number of each token owned by the user) can be used to order the request under the chain at the account level desired by the user. 

Transfer means changing the token balance of two accounts in the Merkle Tree. Because the balance is stored in its subtree, only the small subtree needs to be updated twice. The account is only updated once. 

The L2 state is constituted by two parts: Account Root and Token Leaf Node under the account. 

**Account**

![Account](https://file.zktube.io/images/whitepaper/Account.png)

**Information on each Token Node**

![Information on each Token Node](https://file.zktube.io/images/whitepaper/Information.png)

### 3.2. zkTube Operating Mechanism

The zkTube system covers two different roles: Ordinary User and System Role.

**Ordinary User**

Ordinary User refers to the account corresponding to Layer 2 of zkTube. The user constructs a transfer transaction and signs it with a private key, then collects the transaction in the Pool, and submits it to the first floor using the ETH sender.

**System Role**

ZK Rollup=Rollup technology + Zero-Knowledge proof. The core logic design of zkTube is to realize the interaction between L2 data and contract through the rollup and zero-knowledge proof PLONK algorithm. The main design breakthroughs are manifested in the collaboration between different programs.

The Watcher in the zkTube design is responsible for monitoring L1 and L2 transactions and adding the monitored to the Data Pool, then Block Proposer selects three dimensions of time, number and data size, to package the transactions in the Data Pool.

The packaged transaction is updated by the State Keeper and is pending to the BlockCommiter. At this time, the Block Commiter stores the block information in storage to obtain the proof.

The zkTube Node extracts the Block from Storage and generates Witness (information required for proof), and stores it in storage again.

Block Commiter obtains the updated state and pubdata, submits the pubdata to the chain, and the transaction enters the Committed state. At the same time, Block Commiter needs to prove the latest state. The proof process is calculated by zkTube Prover.

zkTube Prover checks the information that needs to be certified from storage, generates a Zero-Knowledge proof, and then stores the proof in storage. Block Commiter gets the proof and sends it to L1 through the sender, and finally proves that the transaction with no issues entering into the Verified state.

**Incentive Mechanisms**

To ensure the timeliness, stability, and security of the network, also to increase the enthusiasm of zkTube Prover, zkTube has designed a complex algorithm mechanism to ensure that Prover does not do evil. Frequency of Prover submission of tasks, submission duration, and mortgage tokens are weighted to judge, and the qualified Prover can get ZKT as a reward through the zkTube reward mechanism.

**Prover Adopts a Decentralized Design**

The main function of Prover is to generate Zero-Knowledge proof data, and the user's asset data signature is managed by the user's wallet (such as MetaMask). The contract and service of zkTube are responsible for the transfer and storage of data, and ultimately will not affect the user's assets. Originally, zkTube or another organization could do the Prover.

zkTube uses decentralization for the following purposes:

1.zkTube allows as many users as possible to provide professional mining machines to participate in the provision of the Prover, avoiding the risks caused by a monopoly.

2.Prevents various authority institutions and avoids single-point risks.

3.Prevents the behavior of an organization or a combination of organizations manipulating zkTube.

4.When there is a task to receive, there will be CPU consumption.

### 3.3 Three Types of Operations for a Trader on Layer 2

**Sign Up**

To register, users must provide a Merkle tree branch showing some index i, where i=0 and A[i]=0 or i 0 and A[i] = 0 and A[i-1] != 0. The Merkle tree is updated so that A[i] is now equal to the address of msg. sender and the Merkle tree branch is recorded so that the client can read the log to get all the data needed to create its Merkle tree branch.

**Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer**

To deposit or withdraw, users need to provide a Merkle tree branch, which shows some index h (where A[h] is equal to the address of msg. sender) and the corresponding branch B[h], and they want to deposit or withdraw/ the transfer amount m (negative for withdrawal). The contract checks this B[h][0] + m>= 0. If m> 0, it verifies (if the system is used for ETH) msg. value == m * 10* *12 (that is, the basic unit of the system is 10 ^ {-6} ETH), otherwise it will call the appropriate ERC20 contract. If so, it sends the ETH or token to the contract address. Then, let its smart contract generate and update the Merkle tree root. Please note that to improve efficiency, the registration and deposit steps of traders who have not yet registered can be combined using transferFrom (msg.sender, self, m * 10* *12)m <0msg.senderB[i][0] +=m.

**Send**

To send, the user constructs the data: From Address to Address (By index 3 bytes), number (represented by a power of 10 in scientific notation, the general number of bytes is <= 4), gas cost (0-0.5 bytes), random number (2 bytes). User broadcasting (From, To, Amountï¼ŒFeeï¼ŒNonce) and add a Signature.
Prover can aggregate many transactions in the pool and create ZK to use the Plonk protocol to prove that when all operations are processed in order, at the beginning of each operation B[from][0] >= amount + fee, B [from][1] == nonce and from the known valid signature A[from], then update the Merkle root to have B[from][0] -= amount + fee, B[to][0] += amount, B [relayer][0] += fee, B[from][1] += 1. A log is issued to remind users that the transaction is an unverified payment transaction, and they will need to recalculate their Merkle tree witnesses.

### 3.4 Batch

When the merchant receives the transaction, he must "execute" it. The so-called execution, in essence, is to change the state of the relevant account, and STF is a function to change the state of the account. STF is an abbreviation for the state transition function. 

The state refers to the state machine, each state machine has a state at a time. We can assume that the initial state is a state machine S [0]. When an action T [1] acts on the state machine,the state of the state machine has migrated.

We can use the following equation to represent the migration process.

The three states of the transaction: initiated, pending, completed (Verified means that the block has been validated on Layer 1).

**S[1] = STF(S[0], T[1])**

Here S [0] is the initial state, S [1] is an execution state of the state machine after-action T [1]. Then several new actions T [2], T [3], â€¦, T [n] continue to act on the state machine. The state machine migration is sequential.

**S[2] = STF(S[1], T[2])**

**S[3] = STF(S[2], T[3])**

**â€¦**

**S[n] = STF[S[n-1], T[n]]**

Briefly, we can also combine T[1], T[2] ... , T[n] as a whole. The state transfer process can be simplified as:

**S[n] = STF(S[0], T[1], T[2], â€¦, T[n])**

More generally, suppose the current state of the state machine is PRE _STATE, then there are n Actions T [1], T [2], â€¦, T [n] that are sequentially applied to the state machine, then the state machine is POST _STATE, this can be expressed as:

**POST_STATE = STF(PRE_STATE, T[1], T[2], â€¦, T[n])**

If the above Action is replaced by a transfer transaction, the set of accounts in the system is treated as a state machine, then the entire process is the on-chain transaction execution. The execution of the transaction changes the global state of the whole chain. The global state on the chain is also the state set of each account, which is formed into a Merkle tree. The leaf node of the tree is the account state, and the root of the tree can be directly used to represent the state set. Therefore, the above PRE _STATE and POST _STATE are the roots of the global account status tree.

After each batch, it needs to be submitted to L1. In order to ensure security and to match the contract status root of L1, Zero-Knowledge proof verification of the batch at the time of submission is required.

### 3.5 Validity Proofs

The account information of all users is maintained in a Merkle tree. The root of the Merkle tree is recorded in a smart contract on the chain. The root of this value also represents the current state of all accounts across the system. When a user initiates a remittance transaction, this state changes. However, the changes must be made according to the following rules.

1.First, we must ensure the legitimacy of the transaction.

- Is there is enough money in the remittance account to pay the remittance amount and the processing fee.

- Is the nonce of the remittance account correct?

- Is the signature of the remittance transaction correct?

2.Then, the corresponding role in the system executes the transfer transaction, modifies the leaf nodes of the transfer-out account and transfer-in account in the Merkle tree. It then recalculates the root of the new Merkle tree.

3.Repeating the second step, Prover will process multiple transactions at one time in the sequence, and then submit the root of the final calculation of the Merkle tree as a new state to the on-chain contract. However, to prevent fraud in the batch submitted by Prover, it is required to verify and generate a signature before submission.

The proof is as followsï¼š

After the Pool has collected a series of transactions, it needs to use the predefined ZK PLONK protocol to generate a PROOF by:

- Making sure that the nonce, value, charge in each transaction T[1], T[2], â€¦, T[n] are all correct and the signature is correct.

- Making sure there is no problem with the state transition, i.e. STF(PRE_ STATE, T[1], T[2], â€¦, T[n]) = POST _STATE.

- Then submitting this PROOF along with POST _STATE, t [1], t [2], â€¦, t[n] to the chain contract. Among them, t [1], t [2], â€¦, t[n] are simplified information of the transaction, without nonce and signature. Therefore, t[i] is smaller than T[i].

Then the smart contract just verifies that the PROOF is correct. If the PROOF is correct and the state stored in the contract is replaced by PRE _STATE, then the new state POST _STATE is added to the contract and replaces the state.

Since Prover must generate the PROOF of the ZK PLONK protocol before submitting to the contract, if the Prover modifies the user's transaction maliciously, the PROOF will not be verified.

In addition, since the transactions t[1], t[2], ..., t[n] submitted to the chain do not contain nonce and signature, the data on the chain will become smaller (in the above examples, only 11 bytes will be chained per transaction).

At this time, Prover has been unable to modify the user's transaction due to certification restrictions. However, a malicious Prover can still refuse to serve a transactor. To prevent this behavior, the contract supports on-chain withdrawal; that is, any transactor can withdraw its token from the chain.

### 3.6 Compression Mechanism

In terms of compression, zkTube adopts the compression principle ZK Rollup, making the file smaller.

For example, a simple Ethereum transaction (sending ETH) is about 110 bytes in size. The ETH transfer on zkTube is only about 12 bytes in size:

![Compression Mechanism](https://file.zktube.io/images/whitepaper/Compression.png)

**The following explains each parametric in the above graphic:**

**Nonce:** The main purpose of this parameter is to prevent replay attacks. If the current account of the random number is 5, then the next transaction for the account must contain 5 random numbers, but when the transaction has been processed, the random number in the account is increased to 6, so the transaction cannot be reprocessed. In zkTube, we can eliminate the random number, because we can directly restore the previous state of the random number. If someone tries to use a random number to replay a previous transaction, the signature cannot be verified, because the signature is checked against data that contains a high random number.

**Gas Price:** Users pay a fixed gas price range. It is billed according to 14 times a power of 2. It will be adjusted according to the price of Ethereum. Of course, users can customize the adjustment according to the range between the minimum and maximum.

**Gas:** Gas form is set as a power of 2, which is set by zkTube.

**To:** You can replace a 20-byte address with an index. For example, if an address is added to the Merkel tree addresses of 4527, we simply use the index 4527 to represent it and then add a "subtree" to store the mapping between the index and the address itself.

**Value:** Use scientific notation to store the value. The number of bits supported by each currency is different, and the number of bytes ranges from 0 to 0.5.

**Signature:** Use the BLS aggregation signature to aggregate a large number of signatures into about 32-96 bytes and complete the ZK PLONK signature. The aggregate signature can be checked at one time based on the message set and batch sender set. The "~0.5" in the table indicates that there is a limit to the number of signatures that can be included in an aggregate signature.

**From:** Replacing a 20-byte address with an index works the same way as To.

**Total:** We can use a scientific approach to store multiple values, the same as with the Value above.

### 3.7. Batch Packaging and State Root Isolation 

zkTube adopts independent batch packaging, separating the batch of committed L2 transactions from the process of submitting state root.

Unlike in the past, zkTube separates batches, sorts them according to time, and then certifies, validates them and updates their status when they are submitted to the Ethereum L1, so that operators can commit multiple batches at once, and multiple operators can commit different batches simultaneously.

The advantages are as followsï¼š

- This enables multiple batches to be released simultaneously to improve audit resistance, while avoiding the problem of some batches being packaged first and others becoming ineffective.

- If a state root is invalid, instead of rolling back the whole batch, we can just roll back the state root and wait for someone else to provide a new state root for the batch. This ensures that the transaction from the sender will not be rolled back.

### 3.8. zkTube Technology Improvement (Based on PLONK Algorithm Optimization)

zkTube uses the Zero-Knowledge proof PLONK algorithm in Layer 2. Theoretically, the SNTARKS algorithm is the most secure. It does not rely on the assumption of pairing and exponential knowledge but is completely based on hash value and information theory to calculate, which is an anti-quantum computer attack. Correspondingly, it has increased the number of proof bytes, from the original 288 bytes (b) to several kilobytes (kb), which is not suitable for zkTube to build a general Layer 2 protocol. Secondly, one of the biggest problems with STARKs is that it is not universal. It requires different arithmetic solutions for different problems or scenarios. It is not practical for zkTube at present. Maybe it will be a good choice for Layer 2 sharding technology when Ethereum 2.0 launches in the future.

SNARKs is the algorithm that uses the least number of bytes in the algorithm, and Groth16 is the one that uses the most. First of all, Groth16 is non-general, and it relies on one-time non-upgradable settings. If the system changes or encounters any small bug, new rituals are needed to deploy and fix it. Secondly, different CRS (the common reference string) is needed for different problems, which is equivalent to designing different circuits for different scenes. Therefore, this algorithm is used for specific scenes, such as DEX, payment and other simple scene circuit designs.

The advantage of PLONK is that it supports universal and upgradeable reference strings, and as long as the size of the circuit design does not exceed the upper limit of the SRS threshold, some scenes and functions can share the same SRS, which is very helpful to zkTube. zkTube utilizes this feature to maximize this feature in specific scenarios such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, buy, and sell. Originally, its proof time was shortened by about five times compared with SNARKs, but after the optimization of zkTube, the proof time was shortened about 15-20 times.

To maximize the CPU, we optimize from the two points of reducing the occupied memory and reasonably allocate memory. In the circuit design, we try our best to meet a general SRS, so in the Merkel tree we divided SRS into different groups and proves. Therefore, in the Merkel tree, we group different SRSs and prove them to introduce repeated data calculations to reduce memory usage as much as possible. At the same time, we used a monitoring mechanism to adjust the allocation of memory. For example, if a certain circuit was too high frequency during this period, a special thread is used to process the pre-stored scheme to achieve the effect of allocating memory.

### 3.9 zkTube Scaling Effect

On the existing Ethereum chain, the upper limit of gas is 12.5 million. In a transaction, each byte of data costs 16 gas. This means that if a block contains only one batch (we say that it is equivalent to packaging a ZK Rollup and spending 500,000 gas on proof verification), that batch can contain (12 million / 16) 750,000 bytes of data. As shown above, for an Ethereum transfer Rollup, each user operation only needs 12 bytes, which means that the batch of transactions can contain up to 62,500 transactions. Now the average block time is 13 seconds, which is equivalent to about 4807 transactions per second (compared to the current direct transfer on Ethereum which is 12.5 million /21000/13~=45 transactions per second).

The following table is an another application example.

![zkTube Scaling Effect](https://file.zktube.io/images/whitepaper/Effect.png)


## 4. zkTube Protocol Support

### 4.1 Deposit

If the ETH is stored in a zkTube Layer 2 account, the object created when the wallet is created must have access to the Ethereum signer.

If the ERC-20 token is stored, the transfer of the token must be approved through the wallet first, so that the contract can transfer it to the Layer 2 account. In this process, users can unlock ERC20 tokens to obtain permanent approval for ERC20 deposits.

After submitting the operation to the Ethereum network, we must wait for a certain number of confirmations before we can accept it in the zkTube Layer 2 network. After submitting the transaction to the zkTube network, the recipient can use the funds. If Prover does not process the deposit after a few seconds, the user can directly withdraw the deposit amount + ETH fee from the contract.

### 4.2 Transfer

When the L2 account is transferring or withdrawing, the user needs to sign and associate the account with the private key of zkTube, which is the so-called unlocked account in the UI form.

"To the address" can be a zkTube account or an uncreated Ethereum address. If it is an Ethereum address, the system will create an account on zkTube based on the "To address". At this time, the user only needs to use this address to connect to zkTube Layer 2 to check the balance.

After confirming the above operations, before sending the transaction, the user will be required to use their Ethereum account to sign a specific message with transaction details. During the transfer process, Prover needs to be paid a certain certification fee, any currency supported by zkTube can be used as a handling fee. After the mainnet is launched, only ZKT will be supported for payment.

### 4.3 Withdraw

When the L2 account is transferring or withdrawing, the user needs to sign and associate the account with the private key of zkTube, which is the so-called unlocked account in the UI form.

Since the zkTube L1 account and L2 account correspond one-to-one and share a private key, the account address is consistent, which supports transferring to this address as well as other ETH addresses. It is important to note that whether transferring between L2 accounts or directly withdrawing the balance from L2 to L1, the "To address" supports the Ethereum address and once transferred to some contract address, it will not be retrieved unless the contract address supports the relevant protocol.
After confirming the above operations, before sending the transaction, the user will be required to use their Ethereum account to sign a specific message with transaction details. During the transfer process, Prover needs to be paid a certain certification fee. Any currency supported by zkTube can be used as a handling fee. After the mainnet is launched, only ZKT will be supported for payment.

### 4.4 Buy
The underlying protocol of zkTube supports the purchase of ETH and ERC20 tokens directly through fiat currency through third-party payment. At the protocol layer, we will support the purchased tokens reachomg the Layer 1 account, and also support the Layer 2 account. The plan to reach the Layer 1 account is the same as the transfer between ETH, and the plan to reach the Layer 2 account is the same as the Deposit method.



### 4.5 Sell

zkTube is working with some third-party payment companies to sell ETH and ERC20 directly through fiat currency. At the protocol layer, we will support the token sold to be deducted from the Layer 1 account and also support the Layer 2 account, depending on the seller. The method of deduction from the Layer 1 account is the same as the transfer method between ETH, and the method of deduction from the Layer2 account is the same as the Withdraw method.

### 4.6 zkTube Scan

zkTube has also developed its web3.0 browser, and currently supports the main network and test network (temporarily supporting Ropsten and Rinkeby) Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, Buy, Sell related records queries.

### 4.7 NFT

The underlying protocol of zkTube has also been extended in the NFT field to support NFT transactions on L2 and, at the same time, the main bytes are submitted to L1 as proof through the zkPLONK protocol. In addition, zkTube will support a large number of Dapps, including games that will be displayed in the PayTube wallet, providing the underlying protocol for these Dapps. Regardless of the scene or the protocol layer, it will bring great value to the game project and there are many scene applications. 

### 4.8. Cross Rollup

zkTube implements the data interaction between Rollup A and Rollup B through the smart contract on Ivan and Rollup A. When IVAN_A receives a transaction that needs to be processed, it will use TRADE_VALUE as a note to include the address destination. After a certain period, this task will be sent to IBAN_B. IBAN_B will queue up the withdrawal of TRADE_VALUE tokens to the address destination.

When Ivan discovers that he has received the money in Ivan_A, he can personally send TRADE_VALUE* (1-fee) tokens to DESTINATION. He can use the IVAN_B method to send a transaction to complete the above operation. This method saves a record to prevent the automatic sending clause in the contract from triggering the transaction.

### 4.9 Create a Wallet

Ways to create a Layer 2 account include:

1.Successfully create a wallet in zkTube, and a corresponding L2 account will be generated.

2.Successfully use a private key to import a wallet in zkTube, and a corresponding L2 account will be generated.

Every transaction involves an Ethereum signature and permission, so there is special processing for the signature. As long as the user creates a transaction in the zkTube network wallet, he must have a zkTube key pair associated with it. The zkTube keys are processed by the Signer object. These keys can be created by deriving them from the Ethereum signature of a specific message. If the user does not provide Signer and the key is created using another method, this method is used by default.
In order to make the zkTube key valid, the user should use the set signature key to sign or authorize once in the zkTube network.

**Signature**

In the zkTube network, Signer is used to sign authorization during the process of creating a wallet, authorizing an ERC20 transfer, Transfer, Withdraw, etc.
Among them, transactions such as Transfer and Withdraw are signed. The purpose of this signature is to provide higher security if the zkTube key of the wallet is stolen. The user is required to sign the transaction description and perform a signature check when submitting the transaction to zkTube.

**Supported Signature Types**

Ethereum Signature

Support ERC1271 smart contract protocol

## 5. Economic Model

### 5.1 Economic Design

zkTube's economic design is to keep the interests of all participants in the same direction as the value growth of the zkTube agreement. On the one hand, it must protect the interests of all participants and, on the other hand, it must also maintain the stability of the zkTube system. That is to say, all participating parties contribute to the zkTube system while pursuing their interests.

To achieve our economic design goals, we must think from several aspects, including:

- How to ensure the security of the zkTube protocol.

- How to maintain the sustainable development of the zkTube system.

- How to protect the interests of participants.

- How to maintain the interests of the participants and the value of the zkTube system are in the same direction.

**Before designing the zkTube economic model, let's analyze the existing distributed system model first:**

As the earliest blockchain protocol, Bitcoin uses native tokens to incentivize nodes to verify transactions and uses PoW consensus to coordinate competition between nodes. In the Bitcoin economic model, early block rewards are the major way to maintain the interests of nodes. After the block rewards are reduced in the later stages, fees become the main way to maintain the benefit of nodes.

Bitcoin is widely accepted as having two functions: Value storage and circulation payment. Value store users expect to hold tokens to maintain or increase in value. They are concerned about the security of the Bitcoin network protocol and the policy of currency deflation. Current payment users use the network's peer-to-peer transfer of value, similar to fiat currency payments, to focus on bitcoin's transaction costs and volatile value.

Without changing the existing Bitcoin economic model, the interests of value store users can be guaranteed. In such a user-dominated network, there will not be many transactions so, in the long run, it is difficult for fees to maintain nodes and guarantee network security. This will affect the sustainable development of the whole system.

Ethereum is the largest smart contract platform. The native tokens are used to pay for computing services. Similar to Bitcoin, the service fee may become the main way to maintain the interests of the nodes after the block reward is reduced. The difference is that Ethereum has more transactional users, and its monetary policy is not fixed. It is now an inflation policy.

The planned ETH2.0 system changes the consensus of Ethereum to PoS, which is designed to protect the interests of nodes through perpetual inflation. Inflation will depreciate the value of the token. Its economic model will balance this relationship as much as possible.

After learning the economic models of Bitcoin and Ethereum, zkTube proposed the zkTube economic model and asset system based on its characteristics.

### 5.2 Consensus Design

For a decentralized system, a consensus is particularly important for the system. Different mining mechanisms have slightly different consensus mechanism designs, but their functions are the same. They all have corresponding governance tokens to coordinate the entire system to operate according to certain rules. The Layer 2 network also draws on the Bitcoin mining mechanism to design consensus. First of all, ZKT participated in the incentive and punishment measures of the consensus protocol to ensure the enthusiasm of miners to submit data and anti-cheating methods. Secondly, ZKT uses its Token certificate attributes as the hub of connection protocols and protocol-based applications, such as Defi, NFT and other scenarios. Finally, ZKT is just like BTC, it follows the principles of value growth and quantity deflation in the financial market economy, and can adapt and adjust the market itself.


### 5.3 Composition of Transaction Fees

In the zkTube network, the following fees are the main ones incurred:

- **Deposit.** The ETH transaction fee generated by transferring money from an Ethereum Layer 1 account to a zkTube Layer 2 account, which is charged by Ethereum miners.

- **Transfer.** The transaction fee for zkTube L2 transfer is almost negligible. This fee can be paid in any token supported by the ZKTube platform. The fee is used for L2 miner packaging and zero-knowledge proof verification.

- **Withdraw.** There will be a transaction fee from the zkTube Layer 2 account to the Ethereum Layer 1 account, which can be paid with any tokens supported by the zkTube platform. The fee is used for the packing of the Layer 2 miners and the verification of the zero-knowledge proof.

- **Change pubkey.** This will consume a small amount of ETH, which will be collected by Ethereum miners;

The zkTube protocol will use ZKT to offer a low or free service on DeFi, NFT and various SWAP services.

### 5.4 Economic Benefits

The benefits generated by the zkTube agreement are divided into internal and external.

**Internal Benefits**

First of all, compared with the Ethereum chain, transactions on zkTube have increased TPS and reduced transaction fees. TPS has increased from 14 to 3000+, and the fees have been reduced by about 100 times, improving overall transaction efficiency. This makes the transaction efficiency close to or even surpassing some centralized services; Secondly, zkTube supports the purchase and sale of fiat currencies from all over the world at Layer2, which further improves the circulation efficiency between fiat currencies and various tokens. Finally, there may be a small number of fees in circulation, which can be paid with any token.

**External Benefits**

The underlying protocol of zkTube supports all kinds of applications including the applications of offline entity business attributes, which have been opened up with Layer 2 accounts. The application experience and centralization can be consistent. zkTube has confirmed the cooperation plan with the decentralized Dex Uniswap in the DeFi field. zkTube will provide agreement services to Uniswap to set up Layer 2 swap transactions, 3000+ TPS and very low transaction fees. This ensures that the performance of various swap transactions will not be affected, coupled with negligible transaction fees, will make swap replace centralized exchanges; however, in other areas of DeFi, such as decentralized insurance, decentralized mortgage lending and other fields, it also brings at least a 30 times increase in efficiency; such as NFT collections. Vouchers and games will all use the zkTube protocol to build applications quickly.

### 5.5 On-Chain Governance

zkTube on-chain governance updates and upgrades the protocol through smart contracts. On-chain governance is governed by node voting, punishment, and elimination mechanisms, allowing all ZKT holders to participate in the network construction. The on-chain governance mechanism is still under development.

### 5.6 Community Autonomy

To reward early investors, ZKT will give some investors the right to govern the zkTube agreement, and they can participate in the decision-making of zkTube as important external members. The investors who have invested certain funds in the early stage can obtain the same proportion of the allocation amount following the proportion originally held by the investors during the allotment process.

### 5.11 ZKT Application

As the native token of the zkTube protocol, ZKT represents the rights of the holder and also has practical use-value. ZKT can be used in the following scenarios.

**Governance Token**

zkTube is a decentralized project led by the community. ZKT is the certificate of community participation in governance:

- Users who hold a certain number of ZKT can initiate upgrade proposals, such as modifying the ZKT long-term incentive plan, etc.

- All ZKT holders can vote on the proposal, and the proposal that receives a majority vote will be approved and implemented by the development team.

**Transaction Fees**

ZKT can be used as a transaction fee and fuel in the zkTube network.

**Mining**

As the value carrier of zkTube, ZKT supports Staking, CPU mining and import wallet mining, and the income is ZKT.

**Cryptocurrency Assets**

As the zkTube network grows, the ZKT, as an Ethereum asset, value will continue to rise with market demand.

**Circulation in Defi and NFT**

ZKT will conduct extensive circulation in DeFi, participate in the swap and provide liquidity. It will also launch ZKT insurance and lending services on the insurance and lending platform.

## 6. Token Certificate

ZKT is a functional token that realizes the value of the zkTube network. And it has cross DeFi and NFT circulation performance, similar to ETH in the Ethereum network or DOT in the Polkadot network.

### 6.1 Token Certificate Function

In the zkTube network, ZKT has the following functions:

- Maintains zkTube network consensus.

- A transaction fee for using the network.

- As a transfer fee.

- Cross Defi circulation.

- Cross NFT circulation.

- Apply for nodes and maintain node security.

- It can be used for the election and voting of the governance mechanism on the chain, and to vote on the proposal.

### 6.2 Value of Token Certificate

ZKT is the only Token certificate of the zkTube protocol, and its value depends on the zkTube network. The value of ZKT is positively related to the scale of the zkTube network. When the zkTube protocol is widely used, the demand and value of ZKT will rise accordingly.

ZKT can be used as fuel to pay network fees, which has use value and can be used as a dividend voucher, which can produce certain value by itself.

## 7. ZKT Asset System

### 7.1 ZKT Circulation Mechanism

The zkTube Protocol is a scaling solution for the Ethereum community, so most of the ZKT will be generated by mining and distributed to community participants who maintain the operation of the system.

2.Year 2, 3% will be released in the rest every month.

3.Year 3, 3% will be released every month until completed. 

**Note:** After the end of financing activity, the remainingï¼ˆZKTRï¼‰tokens of zkTube Nodes (3.85%) and Investors (0.6%) will be destroyed before the zkTube
Mainnet Launch.

### 7.2 ZKT Repurchase and Destruction

The zkTube Official will use a certain percentage of transaction fees to repurchase ZKT from the exchange periodically to stabilize the market value of ZKT. The ZKT obtained will be directly destroyed, and no individual or organization may use it for other purposes.

## 8. PayTube Wallet

### 8.1 PayTube Wallet - A Cross-Platform Mobile Wallet

PayTube Wallet is a Web3.0 application on the zkTube network. Users can access any Ethereum Dapp through a one-click link to the wallet. After the connection is established, users can buy/sell cryptocurrency, explore Dapp, staking, insurance, games and a series of operations.

PayTube Wallet is a non-custodial decentralized wallet. In the first version, users need to save their own private keys. (About the private key: The PayTube team is studying and exploring the safest way for users to solve the solution if the private key is lost, without affecting the nature of decentralization.)

PayTube Version 1.0 will provide the basic PC and mobile terminal functions for users, such as deposit, withdrawal, transfer, buy, sell, etc. At the same time, PayTube Wallet will support iOS and Android for users to download and use.


PayTube Wallet will: 

1.Support deposits from L1 to L2.

2.Support the transfer between L2 and L2.

3.Support withdraw from L2 to L1.

4.Realize the data interaction between L1 and L2 and Dapps in the DeFi, such as DEX and NFT.

5.Seamless connection with zkTube Dapp.

6.Support buy and sell between L2 and more than 40 stable currencies including USDT, USDC, TUSD, GUSD, EURS, etc.






## 9. Roadmap

**Ecological Planning of zkTube**

**An Open-Source Payment Network**
