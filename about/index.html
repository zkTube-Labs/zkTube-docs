This license is revocable at any time.</p> <h2 id="_3-zktube-services"><a href="#_3-zktube-services" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.zkTube Services</h2> <p>a.zkTube is software that (a) generates private keys that you may use to send and receive Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”) following zktube protocol; (b) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum-based blockchains (the “Ethereum Networks”) without requiring you to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device; and (c) computational services of generating blocks following zkTube protocol. The private key is derived from a message signed by external Ethereum wallet and can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that wallet address.</p> <p>b.You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your wallet. You must never send messages signed with your wallet associated with an address used with zkTube to any unauthorized party. You must keep your wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the wallet.zkTube cannot assist with password retrieval. zkTube stores your wallet address but does not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your wallet password.</p> <p>c.In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using zkTube, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Ethereum Networks. zkTube Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Ethereum-based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that zkTube can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.</p> <p>d.You must create a wallet by connecting an existing Ethereum wallet. When you create a wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the wallet or safeguard your private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the services’ backup functionality; (c) maintaining the security of your wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your wallet. zkTube charges transaction fees for use of its services. Any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies.</p> <p>e.Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. zkTube has no control over any Ethereum-based blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your account. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Ethereum-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any cryptocurrency related transactions.</p> <p>f.You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.</p> <h2 id="_4-no-offer-or-recommendation"><a href="#_4-no-offer-or-recommendation" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.No offer or recommendation</h2> <p>The website is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation to acquire or dispose of any investment/product/service or to engage in any other transaction in any jurisdiction.
